The goal of this workshop was to introduce you to the fundamental components and capabilities of **Knative Eventing**.

Next Steps for you:

* Deploy **VMware Tanzu Cloud Native Runtimes** (includes Knative) on one of your clusters via the [official VMware documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes-1-0/GUID-cnr-overview.html).
* Deploy some applications with event-driven architecture where the events conform to the *CloudEvents* specification
* Perhaps try a more complex example, such as an ML application for numberplate recognition (also uses CNR's TriggerMesh integration):
